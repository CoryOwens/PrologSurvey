# PrologSurvey
Learning Prolog through short projects.

Starting with the list found [here](https://github.com/CoryOwens/Projects). 

Then moving on to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

The intention is to learn declarative programming for use outside the database. SQL comes fairly naturally to me, if I know the database. Prolog, should (in theory) come quite naturally to me, as I am very good at formal logical proofs. Set conditions, assumptions, and relationships, then define a question. If the scope of the search is well limited, very little time should be needed for optimization, and the programming time should be fluid and unhindered by runtime concerns, allowing for faster prototyping.

I assume I will encounter annoyances with Prolog, so the culmination of this will likely be a new programming language, or possibly a new dialect of prolog with additional syncactic sugar.
