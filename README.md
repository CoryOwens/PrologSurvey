# PrologSurvey
Learning Prolog through Project Euler, and small practical projects.

The objective is to (eventually) go through all the projects in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) using Prolog (or some other declarative programming language).

Once I feel I have a grip on the language, I will start to tackle more "practical" problems, from [this list](https://github.com/CoryOwens/Projects).

The intention is to learn declarative programming for use outside the database. SQL comes fairly naturally to me, if I know the database schema. Prolog, should (in theory) come quite naturally to me, as I am very good at formal logical proofs. Set conditions, assumptions, and relationships, then define a question. If the scope of the search is well limited, very little time should be needed for optimization, and the programming time should be fluid and unhindered by runtime concerns, allowing for faster prototyping.

I assume I will encounter annoyances with Prolog (as a language), so the culmination of this will likely be a new declarative programming language, or possibly a new dialect of prolog with additional syncactic sugar.
